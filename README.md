Here are some of the things that Markdown can do:

## Headings can be added by typing "#" as seen in the editor
### The amount of "#" indicates the heading number; this would be heading 3

You can also use *italics* and **bolded** text wherever you wish.

As seen previously, blockquotes are a thing for quoting stuff!

And you can write in-line code like this: `console.log("Very crappy code");` In-line means it's located inside regular text.

Markdown has URL support; here is [a link to my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Roman-Octavian).

There are unordered and ordered lists too:
* Unordered list element
* Unordered list element
1. Ordered list element
1. Ordered list element

Here's a code block, for a change:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
And, lastly, aside from cat gifs, images can also be embedded with Markdown:
